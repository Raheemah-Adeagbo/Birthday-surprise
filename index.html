      <p>Hiii<br>This letter might find you or not...</p>
      <p>I know you are wondering what all these is all about but be calm okay, this is just me trying to express how I feel about you.</p> I may have never told you before, but I bless the day that I met you. I never knew I could like or love someone this much and I‚Äôm happy it‚Äôs you I get to love like this.
I can vividly remember the day we met, I was wearing a purple singlet and I was kinda busy with my assignment but then when you entered my room, your perfume was the first thing that attracted me to you then your lips before I even saw your face. I would not say it was love at first sight cos it was actually not and I was hell bent on not falling for you in anyways cos I knew deep down that it was going to end in tears. But despite my reservations about falling, I never knew me falling for you was inevitable and I kept falling all over and over again for you.
It was a gradual process for me. I never knew I could like someone this much. I love the way you say my name, the way you look at me as if I‚Äôm the only one you can see, the way you care about my health even when I thought you never cared.
The day you came when I wanted to end it all and wrote you a message, I was not expecting to show up and I didn‚Äôt even want you to show up cos we were not speaking at the time. But you came and I‚Äôm sure you were wondering why you were part of the people I wrote a message too, the reason was because even after knowing you for a short period of time, you became my favorite person and I kept falling for you.
You want to the funniest part?? It‚Äôs the fact that when I think I can‚Äôt fall for you again, I fall more in love with you than before. All my thoughts are centered around you and I just want to know how you are doing and if I‚Äôm also in your thoughts or mind.
But then it‚Äôs an unrequited love cos only me seems to like and love you and it‚Äôs fine, Atleast I get to love you in my own way and mind.
I don‚Äôt know what it is about you that makes me feel this way but I‚Äôm happy I got to meet you and know you cos you make my days brighter and more good with just your presence, or the way I glow up anytime your messages come in or the way I can‚Äôt stop smiling anytime I hear your name or say your name.
<p>I love you oluwashemilore </p>
